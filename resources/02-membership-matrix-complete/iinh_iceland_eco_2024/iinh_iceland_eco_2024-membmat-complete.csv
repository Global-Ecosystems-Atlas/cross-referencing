In pebble and boulder beaches, algae have better stability and are more resistant to surf than in beaches where the substrate is looser. Larger algae only grow where the substrate is firm enough and does not topple over in a surf. The more the surf, the more stable the substrate must be for algae to thrive. They also do not thrive well in pebble and boulder beaches where loose gravel and sand are washed up by the waves and scrape vegetation from the substrate.

Estuaries at marine lagoons are either open or closed and access to the sea varies. Tides are delayed in entering the lagoons, they are reduced or even non-existent, and the outflow usually takes longer than the inflow. In some lagoons, the sea rises at every high tide, in others only very rarely. Due to reduced tides, the shores of marine lagoons are often rather small. Estuaries can widen or narrow, due to natural causes or due to human activities, and the lagoons can change greatly as a result (Agnar Ingólfsson 1990, 2005).The salinity of marine lagoons varies and depends on factors such as freshwater inflow, storm frequency, tides and sea inflow into the lagoon. Salinity usually ranges from 10 salinities up to full-salt water (35 S). Biodiversity is often quite sparse and generally decreases with lower salinity, in addition to the type of coastal bed affecting species composition. In rare cases, marine species, such as the coastal eel Gammarus dubeni , are found in brackish lakes near the sea (Agnar Ingólfsson 1990) and such waters are not considered marine lagoons. The boundaries between marine lagoons, estuaries and coastal waters are often unclear, but salinity is usually used to distinguish between them. If salinity was unknown, aerial photographs were used to assess how easy sea access is to the lagoon.The description of marine lagoons is based almost exclusively on the work of Agnar Ingólfsson (1990), which covers lagoons larger than 10 ha. On the coast, however, there are more and smaller lagoons that could probably be classified as marine lagoons, but they are all almost unexplored. Marine lagoons are classified into high-saline lagoons and clay lagoons, among other things according to salinity, type of estuary, tides and shoreline. For example, high-saline lagoons usually have high salinity, while it varies in clay lagoons.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,
