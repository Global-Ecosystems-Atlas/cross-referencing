2/12/2025,tess_harmer,v1.1,229,syke_finland_forest_2021,kp1_6_vmi21,b1,2,Herb-rich heath forests ,"The dominant tree species in herb-rich heath forests is usually spruce (Picea abies), less commonly silver birch (Betula pendula) or pine (Pinus sylvestris). Additionally, downy birch (B. pubescens), aspen (Populus tremula), goat willow (Salix caprea), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), and bird cherry (Prunus padus) can grow as secondary trees. The most common shrub layer species are juniper (Juniperus communis) and, except in the northernmost Finland, raspberry (Rubus idaea), and in moist places also willows (Salix spp.) and alder buckthorn (Frangula alnus).
In the field layer, herbs are more common than dwarf shrubs. There are usually several herbaceous and grass-like species, the most typical being wood cranesbill (Geranium sylvaticum), oak fern (Gymnocarpium dryopteris), and in southern Finland wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella) and in northern Finland bunchberry (Cornus suecica). The most common dwarf shrubs are tall bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), lingonberry (V. vitis-idaea), which usually does not bloom in herb-rich heath forests, and twinflower (Linnaea borealis) in spruce forests. The bottom layer is patchy. In southern Finland, the dominant species in the bottom layer are red-stemmed feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi), Brachythecium mosses (Brachythecium spp.), and glittering wood-moss (Hylocomium splendens), while in northern Finland, in addition to glittering wood-moss, the most common species is common haircap moss (Polytrichum commune). Also, rough-stalked feather-moss (Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus) and rose moss (Rhodobryum roseum) are typical species of herb-rich heath forests, especially in mature forests.
The soil of herb-rich heath forests consists of varying proportions of mor humus and mull; the pH of the humus is about 4.5.
The most important factors describing the ecological quality of herb-rich heath forests are related to the structure of the tree stand and natural disturbances. In high-quality occurrences, the canopy layer is heterogeneous, and the spatial distribution of trees is variable. The proportion of deciduous trees in the living tree stand is high, especially in young successional stages. There are many large trees (Nilsson et al. 2003), and some of them remain alive even in natural disturbances that renew the tree stand, such as storms. The amount of dead wood is tens of cubic meters per hectare (Siitonen 2001). The water balance of the forest is natural (no drainage), and mineral soil is exposed mainly when the root plates of fallen trees are lifted. The structure and dynamics of the forest are reflected in the species composition: in high-quality occurrences, the species living on dead wood and as epiphytes are abundant and diverse (Siitonen 2001).",,,,,,0.6,0.35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
2/12/2025,tess_harmer,v1.1,229,syke_finland_forest_2021,kp1_6_vmi21,b1,3,Mesic forests,"Mesic heath forests can be dominated by spruce (Picea abies), pine (Pinus sylvestris), or deciduous trees, or they can be mixed forests. In the shrub layer, in addition to tree seedlings, rowan (Sorbus aucuparia) and juniper (Juniperus communis) often grow, and in young successional stages also raspberry (Rubus idaeus) and in swampy areas willows (Salix spp.). In the field layer, dwarf shrubs are dominant, especially bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus), lingonberry (V. vitis-idaea), and twinflower (Linnaea borealis), and in the north also crowberry (Empetrum nigrum), Labrador tea (Rhododendron tomentosum), and bog bilberry (V. uliginosum).

Characteristic species of mesic heath forests among herbs include false lily of the valley (Maianthemum bifolium), chickweed wintergreen (Lysimachia europea), one-flowered wintergreen (Orthilia secunda), narrow buckler fern (Dryopteris carthusiana), wood horsetail (Equisetum sylvaticum), and stiff clubmoss (Spinulum annotinum). The bottom layer is covered by mosses such as red-stemmed feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi), glittering wood-moss (Hylocomium splendens), fork mosses (Dicranum spp.), and comb moss (Ptilidium crista-castrensis), and in young successional stages also haircap mosses (Polytrichum spp.).

Fresh heath forests have podzol soil, with a dense humus layer a few centimeters thick (pH around 4.0). In well-established areas, the humus layer can be up to 20 cm thick.

The most important factors describing the ecological quality of fresh heath forests are related to the structure of the tree stand and natural disturbances.

2/12/2025,tess_harmer,v1.1,229,syke_finland_forest_2021,kp1_6_vmi21,b1,4,Sub-xeric forests,"The dominant tree species in sub-xeric heath forests is usually pine (Pinus sylvestris), but spruce (Picea abies) and birches (Betula spp.) also occur in this habitat type, sometimes as the main tree species. Additionally, individual secondary trees can include aspen (Populus tremula), grey alder (Alnus incana), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), and goat willow (Salix caprea). In the shrub layer, in addition to tree seedlings, juniper (Juniperus communis) and in swampy areas willows (Salix spp.) grow.

Sub-xeric heath forests generally are dominated by mosses and dwarf shrubs, with patches of lichens. The most common dwarf shrubs are lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and bilberry (V. myrtillus), and in the north also crowberry (Empetrum nigrum). Heather (Calluna vulgaris) can also be abundant, especially in young successional stages. There are few herbs, and they do not grow as lushly as in mesic heath forests. The dominant species in the bottom layer is red-stemmed feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi), which together with glittering wood-moss (Hylocomium splendens), fork mosses (Dicranum spp.), and patches of lichens forms a continuous cover.

The podzol soil of sub-xeric heath forests is composed of a humus layer bound by fungal hyphae, with a pH of about 3.8.

There is hardly any shrub layer, but small junipers and tree seedlings can grow sparsely. In the field layer, the dominant species are heather (Calluna vulgaris) and lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), sometimes also bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) and bilberry (V. myrtillus), and in the north additionally crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) and bog bilberry (V. uliginosum). The bottom layer of xeric heath forests in southern Finland is moss-dominated, while in northern Finland it is lichen-dominated. The most common mosses are red-stemmed feather moss (Pleurozium schreberi) and fork mosses (Dicranum spp.), and the most common lichens are reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.).

2/12/2025,tess_harmer,v1.1,229,syke_finland_forest_2021,kp1_6_vmi21,b1,6,Barren heath forests,"In barren heath forests, the only tree species that grows to a tree-like size is pine (Pinus sylvestris), but there can also be stunted aspens (Populus tremula) or downy birches (Betula pubescens) mixed in. The shrub layer consists of small pines or is absent altogether. In the field layer, sparse stunted heather (Calluna vulgaris), lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea), bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi), and crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) grow, along with individual tree seedlings, and in the north also bilberry (V. myrtillus) and northern firmoss (Diphasiastrum complanatum). The forest floor is almost entirely covered by a lichen mat formed by reindeer lichens (Cladonia spp.), rock foam lichens (Stereocaulon spp.), and true Iceland lichen (Cetraria islandica).

The thin and acidic (pH around 3.6) humus layer of barren heath forests consists of slowly decomposing lichens, pine needles, and dwarf shrub litter.

The most important variables describing the ecological quality of barren heath forests are related to the structure of the tree stand and natural disturbances. In high-quality occurrences, the canopy layer is heterogeneous, and the spatial distribution of trees is variable. In addition to pine, the living tree stand can include individual deciduous trees.
