This unit is dominated by barren soils or bedrock and lacks much cover of vascular plants. Biological soil crusts cover most soils with a few scattered vascular plants, lichens, and mosses. Woody plants, sedges (Cyperaceae), and bog mosses (e.g. Sphagnum spp.) are normally absent. Horizontal plant cover is sparse (2–40% cover), and vertical structure is very low (generally < 2 cm tall), with a single layer of plants where they occur. In upland areas, vascular plant cover is generally very sparse (< 2%), often in crevices between stones or small cryoturbated polygons and hummocks (< 50 cm diameter). Snow-flush communities, composed mainly of bryophytes and biological soil crusts with cyanobacteria, often form dark streaks on the otherwise barren lands of bioclimate subzones A and B. Map unit G1 is a common inclusion in more mesic areas. B1 is also mapped in recently deglaciated areas of other subzones, and was used to map small areas of mudflats and barren wetlands on coasts and deltas in more southern subzones where plant communities are not described.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
