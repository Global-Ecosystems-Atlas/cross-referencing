Fault-bounded escarpments frequently control the direction of streams and location of lakes (Ledingham and Peterson 1984).  Faults and fractures channel groundwater. Vegetation in lakes includes Myriophyllum triphyllum, various bryophytes, and abundant algae including at least 250 species of diatoms.",F2.2,Small permanent freshwater lakes,F2.2 Small permanent freshwater lakes,93

It is backed by steep slopes leading up to the plateau and is mantled by a complex mosaic of tall and short herb closed vegetation, mires and lakes. Some areas are dominated by bryophytes. The platform's low slope, with abundant precipitation and drainage from the plateau has led to waterlogging in many parts. The category 'closed vegetation on western and northern marine-cut platform' includes parts of Taylor's (1955) sub-glacial herbfield formation, and parts of his bog and fen formations.",MT1.2,Muddy shorelines,MT1.2 Muddy shorelines,158

This category, which can enclose small mires, also occurs on the eastern coast-facing slopes, particularly below the change of slope noted on the map. The floristic (species) composition is complex. It ranges from extensive stands of Acaena spp. that are almost monospecific to communities made up of most of the vascular species of the island. Sedge-like plants such as Luzula crinita are abundantly and widely distributed in this vegetation category. Bryophytes make an important contribution to the total ground cover. The category 'closed short herb vegetation' includes most of Taylor's (1955) sub-glacial herbfield formation.",T6.4,Temperate alpine grasslands and shrublands,T6.4 Temperate alpine grasslands and shrublands,41

Poa foliosa and S. polaris may occur in almost monospecific stands, but they commonly occur together. The tall vegetation is absent on gentler slopes near the coast where drainage is poor, and on unstable surfaces such as active scree, outwash fans, and crumbling rocky outcrops. Closed tall herb vegetation also occurs on the western and southern steep coast-facing slopes below the plateau, but there it is included in the category 'vegetation on western and southern coast-facing slopes'. The category 'closed tall herb vegetation' covers Taylor's (1955) wet tussock grassland formation.",MT2.1,Coastal shrublands and grasslands,MT2.1 Coastal shrublands and grasslands,163

Brown algae grow to many metres in length. Southern kelps, particularly the bull kelp, Durvillaea antarctica, from the high tide limit to more than 15m depth, and Macrocystis pyrifera, form impressive masses of floating fronds, particularly prominent along the sheltered eastern coast.

Bryophytes are frequently dominant. Mires occur in valley bottoms where slope angle is low, but where groundwater emerges they occur on quite steep surfaces in very localised areas.

There is commonly a mosaic of polygonal patches in which both the bare ground and the edges of the vegetated areas are subject to erosion. Also common are alternating stripes of vegetation and bare ground, often in the form of stepped benches or terraces. Bryophytes become dominant or codominant with angiosperms such as Azorella macquariensis in the most exposed places. This category includes the feldmark formation of Taylor (1955), and the sparse vegetation on unfavourable soils (Adamson et al 1993).",T6.4,Temperate alpine grasslands and shrublands,T6.4 Temperate alpine grasslands and shrublands,41
