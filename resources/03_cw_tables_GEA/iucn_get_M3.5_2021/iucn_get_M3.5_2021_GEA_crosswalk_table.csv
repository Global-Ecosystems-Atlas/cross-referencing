Without light, they rely on currents and fallout from upper ocean layers for energy and also nutrients. However, their structural complexity provides habitats for a great diversity of dependent species including symbionts, microbial biofilms and associated grazers, and filter-feeding epifauna. Mobile predators like crabs and benthic demersal fish contribute to diverse communities.",M3.5,Deepwater biogenic beds,M3.5 Deepwater biogenic beds,147
