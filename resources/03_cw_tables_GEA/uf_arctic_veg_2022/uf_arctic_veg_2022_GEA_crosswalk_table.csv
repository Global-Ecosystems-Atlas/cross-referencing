9-Dec-25,david_keith,2.1,1,uf_arctic_veg_2022,raster_cavm_v1,Raster code,1,"Cryptogam, herb barren","Barren areas mainly in dry landscapes of bioclimate subzones A and B. This unit is dominated by barren soils or bedrock and lacks much cover of vascular plants. Biological soil crusts cover most soils with a few scattered vascular plants, lichens, and mosses. Woody plants, sedges (Cyperaceae), and bog mosses (e.g. Sphagnum spp.) are normally absent. Horizontal plant cover is sparse (2–40% cover), and vertical structure is very low (generally < 2 cm tall), with a single layer of plants where they occur. In upland areas, vascular plant cover is generally very sparse (< 2%), often in crevices between stones or small cryoturbated polygons and hummocks (< 50 cm diameter). Snow-flush communities, composed mainly of bryophytes and biological soil crusts with cyanobacteria, often form dark streaks on the otherwise barren lands of bioclimate subzones A and B. Map unit G1 is a common inclusion in more mesic areas. B1 is also mapped in recently deglaciated areas of other subzones, and was used to map small areas of mudflats and barren wetlands on coasts and deltas in more southern subzones where plant communities are not described.",T6.3,Polar tundra and deserts,T6.3 Polar tundra and deserts,40

Horizontal plant cover is generally 5–80%, often with a large component of soils covered by biological soils crusts; the vegetation consists of a single layer generally 5–10 cm tall. In bioclimate subzone A, this unit generally occurs in more protected mesic areas with more snow, and except for the greater density of plant cover, is similar in composition to map unit B1. Sedges, woody shrubs, and bog mosses are generally absent. In bioclimate subzone B, the zonal vegetation cover is often > 75% on mesic sites and includes a mix of sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae), grasses (Poaceae), forbs, prostrate dwarf shrubs (Salix spp. and Dryas spp.), lichens, and mosses.
